The selection code (part of parsers folder) convertes a JSON expression to a prefix stack while evaluating the JSON expression for proper syntax.

Below are default keys which are part of scallionnDB set of literals and should be used only in its appropriate context.

*) "_or" : The logical operator OR
*) "_and": The logical operator AND
*) "_eq": The relational operator EQUAL (==)
*) "_neq": The relational operator NOT EQUAL (!=)
*) "_gt": The relational operator GREATER THAN (>)
*) "_gte": The relational operator GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO (>=)
*) "_lt": The relational operator LESSER THAN (<)
*) "_lte": The relational operator LESSER THAN OR EQUAL TO (<=)

The value of an attribute is default to EQUAL, i.e.

{"foo":"bar"} implies, selection of nodes where the attribute "foo" EQUALS "bar". The relational operator EQUALS compares foo to BAR

For other relational operators, the following example format is used

{"foo":{"gt":2}} which implies, selction of nodes where the attribute "foo" is GREATER THAN 2. The relational operator GREATER THAN compares foo to 2

The following checks are performed in addition to the expression evalated as a proper JSON. Value implies what the relational operator compares to.

*) The value to key "_id" should be an alphanumeric string
*) The value to any other key (except operator) can only be of string or numeric type and a valid relational operator
*) The value to an operator key can only be of Array type, each object within the array an Object type and atleast 2 objects in the array
